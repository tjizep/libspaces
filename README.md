****LIB SPACES****
--

    So, What is it ?

Lib(eration) spaces is a library and server for transactional graph and key value storage/persistence. 

    And...
It is flexible in that it can operate as a pure embedded database, memory only, distributed with master master 
replication and the traditional client server mode.
  

    Accessing it

It is designed to be accessed in a non schema oriented way and lends itself to dynamic languages like javascript, 
lua and groovy (*Only* the ones I like **{he,he}**)
